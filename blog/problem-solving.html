            A Time I Was Block By A Simple Problem:
          </h2>
          <p class="blog-container__text">
            One of my first node projects was building a CRUD application, where
            users would post images, rate and, write comments. I spent roughly 2
            weeks on this project, making views, controllers, models, routes,
            and schemas, It was a great time. <br /><br />
            All was great until I started the database implementation. <br />
            I spent hours of trying to get it to work, but it just kept throwing
            errors at me non-stop and I didn't have the knowledge of how to fix
            it, or anyone to ask about it. <br />
            At this time, I was not using version control so I ended up
            rewriting sections multiple times in hope something would change. I
            was at my wits end, about to give up when I reread every line in
            each file. <br /><br />
            It was a spelling mistake.

          <p class="blog-container__text">
            A while ago, I was working on a project where I had to analyse a
            large amount of data. I needed to be able to manipulate and generate
            reports with datasets stored in Excel spreadsheets. If you have
            worked with excel before, you know that it can be a very tedious
            process and not very optimised. <br /><br />
            I knew that I could make this a lot easier using Python. I created a
            script that took the data from the spreadsheets and converted them
            into a Python dictionary and then created functions to analyse it.
            <br />By doing this, the whole process of analysing the data was
            much more efficient and faster

                  This is a great way to outline the steps you need to take in
                  order to solve a problem. Being ables to write your code in
                  plain english gives you a good idea of how to structure your
                  code and helps you spot any potential errors before they
                  occur.

                >
                <p class="mt-1">
                  There are a few reasons why this is a great problem solving
                  technique. Being able to explain your code to another
                  person(or duck in this case) really helps you understand what
                  your code actually does and how each part works. Reading your
                  code to another person, line by line, helps you spot errors
                  that you may not see just by reading it in your head.

                  ><strong>Console Debugging</strong></span
                >
                <p class="mt-1">
                  There are various methods you can use to debug within the
                  console of a browser. You can use console.log() to print out
                  values and track the flow of data, console.table() to print
                  out tabular data, and console.trace() to print out a stack
                  trace.
                </p>

                  ><strong>Googling</strong></span
                >
                <p class="mt-1">
                  This is your best friend when it comes to problem solving. The
                  majority of issues you run into on a project, will have
                  already been answered by another person, on a site like
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <span class="blog-codeblock__span"
                  ><strong>Asking others</strong></span
                >
                <p class="mt-1">
                  this blends in well with the rubber ducky debugging method,
                  but you get actual feedback as well. Sometimes it's easy to
                  get stuck on one issue, and all that it needed to get past it
                  is an outside point of view

                  ><strong>Reflection</strong></span
                >
                <p class="mt-1">
                  Being able to reflect on what you have done at the end, is a
                  good way to make sure that you know what you are talking
                  about. You can use your reflections to help with spaced
                  repetition.
                </p>

                  ><strong>Trying something</strong>
                </span>
                <p class="mt-1">
                  This, in my opinion is the best way to try and solve a
                  problem. By doing this, you go through a process of trial and
                  error and get a grasp on what works and what doesn't.
