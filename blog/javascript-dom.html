          <p class="blog-container__text">
            Javascript is a High-Level, Prototype-Based Object-Oriented,
            Multi-Paradigm, Interpreted Or Just-In-Time Compiled,Dynamic,
            Single-Threaded, Garbage-Collected Programming Language with
            First-Class Functions and a Non-Blocking Event Loop Concurrency
            Model.
          </p>
          <p class="blog-container__text">
            Confused? Well I was at first, but it turns out you can boil it down
            into these simple statements:

                <p class="blog-container__text">
                  JavaScript is a high-level programming language, which means
                  it is designed to be easy for humans to read and write as you
                  don't need to manage the memory.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p class="blog-container__text">
                  JavaScript is prototype-based object-oriented, which means
                  objects can inherit behaviors from other objects.
                </p>
              </li>

              <li>
                <p class="blog-container__text">
                  JavaScript is multi-paradigm, meaning there is more than one
                  way to write it.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p class="blog-container__text">
                  JavaScript is interpreted or just-in-time compiled, which
                  means that it is compiled as it is needed, making it very
                  fast.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p class="blog-container__text">
                  JavaScript is dynamically typed, meaning that variables can be
                  declared without a specific data type.
                </p>
              </li>

                <p class="blog-container__text">
                  JavaScript is garbage-collected, which means that it
                  automatically frees up memory that is no longer being used.

              </li>

                <p class="blog-container__text">
                  JavaScript is single-threaded, which means that only one piece
                  of code can be executed at a time.
                </p>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          <h2 class="heading-secondary">JavaScript Analogy</h2>

          <p class="blog-container__text">
            When building a website, a good way to understand the relationship
            between JavaScript, CSS, and HTML is to think of a house.<br /><br />
            - HTML is the structure (foundations, framing, roofing).<br />
            - CSS is the decoration (wallpaper, art work).<br />
            - JavaScript is the plumbing and electricity (how everything in the
            house works).
          </p>

          <h2 class="heading-secondary">
            What is control flow and loops in JavaScript?
          </h2>
          <p class="blog-container__text">
            In computer science, control flow is the order in which statements
            are executed or performed in a program.
          </p>
          <p class="blog-container__text">
            A loop is a repeating section of code that is executed a certain
            number of times until a condition is met.
          </p>
          <p class="blog-container__text">
            To put this in perspective, control flow is like making a cake. You
            first start by preheating the oven, mixing the ingredients, pouring
            the batter into a pan, and baking for a set amount of time. The
            stages of the recipe are performed in a certain order.
            <br /><br />
            A loop would be the stages of the recipe that need repetition. For
            example, when creaming the butter and sugar together, and because
            the ingredients start separated, you need to repeat the mixing
            process until the ingredients become one.
          </p>

          <h2 class="heading-secondary">The DOM</h2>
          <p class="blog-container__text">
            First off, The DOM is not part of the JavaScript language. The
            Document Object Model, or DOM, is the way HTML code is organised and
            interpreted by the browser. It defines how code is structured and
            how it can be manipulated.
          </p>
          <p class="blog-container__text">
            The DOM is made up of a bunch of nodes and is represented in a way
            similar to a tree, each node is representative of an HTML element,
            and each of those have their own children and properties.
          </p>

          <p class="blog-container__text">
            JavaScript can be used to change, add, and delete elements in the
            DOM tree.
          </p>
          <p class="blog-container__text">
            Below is an example of how JavaScript can change the style of an
            element:
          </p>
          <button class="btn-example">Click Me</button>

          <h2 class="heading-secondary">
            Accessing data in arrays and objects
          </h2>
          <p class="blog-container__text">
            Whether you are trying to pull data out or put it in, there is a
            difference when it comes to arrays and objects. Arrays are stored in
            a linear format, and accessed by indexed numbers, whereas objects
            are indexed key-value pairs, which allows them to be associated with
            a name.
          </p>
          <p class="blog-container__text">
            To access the data in an object, you follow this syntax:
          </p>
          <p class="blog-codeblock">
            <span class="blog-codeblock__span">objectName</span>.keyName, or in
            some cases
            <span class="blog-codeblock__span">objectName</span>[keyName]
          </p>
          <p class="blog-container__text">
            To access the data in an array, you follow this syntax:
          </p>
          <p class="blog-codeblock">
            <span class="blog-codeblock__span">arrayName</span>[indexNumber]
          </p>

          <h2 class="heading-secondary">JavaScript Functions</h2>
          <p class="blog-container__text">
            Functions are the main 'building blocks' of a program. They let
            programs call blocks of code, multiple times without repetition.
          </p>
          <p class="blog-container__text">
            In JavaScript, there are 3 ways of writing a function.
          </p>
          <p class="blog-container__text">
            <span class="blog-codeblock__span">Function declaration</span>: A
            function that can be used before it's declared.
          </p>
          <p class="blog-codeblock blog-codeblock--2">
            <span class="blog-codeblock__span">function</span
            ><span class="blog-codeblock__span-2"> exampleFunction(</span
            >name<span class="blog-codeblock__span-2">)</span>{ <br /><br />

            <span class="blog-codeblock__span-4">return</span> 'Hello'
            <span class="blog-codeblock__span-4"> + </span> name <br /><br />}
          </p>

          <p class="blog-container__text">
            <span class="blog-codeblock__span">Function expression</span>: A
            function value stored in a variable.
          </p>
          <p class="blog-codeblock blog-codeblock--2">
            <span class="blog-codeblock__span">const</span
            ><span class="blog-codeblock__span-2"> exampleFunction</span>
            <span class="blog-codeblock__span-4"> = </span>
            <span class="blog-codeblock__span">function(</span>name<span
              class="blog-codeblock__span-2"
              >)</span
            >{ <br /><br />

            <span class="blog-codeblock__span-4">return</span> 'Hello'
            <span class="blog-codeblock__span-4"> + </span> name <br /><br />}
          </p>
          <p class="blog-container__text">
            <span class="blog-codeblock__span">Arrow function</span>: Good for
            one lines, but lacks some features provided by other types.
          </p>
          <p class="blog-codeblock blog-codeblock--2">
            <span class="blog-codeblock__span">const</span
            ><span class="blog-codeblock__span-2"> exampleFunction</span>

              class="blog-codeblock__span-4"
            >
              => </span
