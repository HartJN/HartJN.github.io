            Situation where I have made an ethical decision
          </h2>
          <p class="blog-container__text">
            I was out for a walk when I found a wallet on the ground. It was
            full of money, roughly $400 in notes, and no ID. While the extra
            money would have been nice, I knew ethically what I had to do. I
            went to the police station to hand it in, only to find the person
            who lost it, was there reporting it. They were extremely grateful,
            as it was their weeks whole paycheck and they would not of had
            enough money to pay for rent and food. Looking back at it, I would
            not hesitate to do the same thing as you never know what the other
            persons situation is.

            How my culture and people around me have influenced my values and
            identity
          </h2>
          <p class="blog-container__text">
            My family have always been kind and respectful to others. This has
            directly influenced my values and how I identify, as I've always
            tried to treat others the same way. I have been taught to be
            considerate and thoughtful towards others.
          </p>

          <h2 class="blog-container__header">My Strengths</h2>
          <p class="blog-container__text">
            Being a proactive problem solver, fast learner and team player will
            help my learning journey as a developer because it will allow me to
            identify and solve problems quickly, learn new concepts and
            technologies quickly and work well with others to achieve common
            goals.
          </p>

          <h2 class="blog-container__header">Limitations of my learning</h2>
          <p class="blog-container__text">
            My writing skills are undoubtedly one of my weaknesses. I haven't
            written much recently, so my skills regressed.<br />
            I can see this affecting my learning journey in several ways. For
            one, it will mean that I have to work harder than others to express
            myself clearly in writing. This can be frustrating for me as I can
            have the knowledge but struggle to express what I mean.
            <br />Despite these challenges, I am confident that I can overcome
            them and still have a successful learning journey. This just means
            that I will need to put in the extra work to improve my writing
            skills.
          </p>
          <h2 class="blog-container__header">Tension within a team</h2>
          <p class="blog-container__text">
            In the past I worked on a group project, where a member did not put
            in the same amount of effort as others. This caused major tension
            within the group when everyone caught on. <br />
            In order to fix this, we got together as a group and talked about
            it. We found out that the person that was falling behind, was afraid
            of admitting that they needed help. Once that was communicated, we
            worked together as a group to find what they were struggling with
            and put together a plan to help them. <br />This ended up being
            highly effective, we went from worrying about due dates, to getting
            the project finished early. All it took was realising that you need
            to communicate with others in your team if you need help.
