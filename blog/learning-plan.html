          <p class="blog-container__text">
            During my time at Dev Academy, I've realised that my goals have
            changed. I used to want to be a specific title, like "software
            engineer" or "web developer". But now, I realise that my goal is to
            be able to present myself as a problem solver rather than a specific
            title.
          </p>
          <p class="blog-container__text">
            I want to be able to use any programming technology to solve a
            problem I am given. I don't want to be limited to a specific
            language or framework. I want to be able to learn new technologies
            as they come out and quickly adapt to them.

            My biggest strengths and limitations for Bootcamp
          </h2>
          <p class="blog-container__text">
            Bootcamp will be a great experience for me. I have a lot of
            strengths that I can bring to the table. However, I do have some
            limitations that I need to be aware of. <br />
            One of my biggest strengths is my past technical experience. This
            will give me a great foundation to build upon but I also understand
            that I do not know everything and will always accept teaching and
            feedback from others. <br /><br />
            My main limitation would be that my self-criticism can sometimes
            hold me back and cause doubt. I need to be able to push through this
            and trust in my abilities.
          </p>
          <h2 class="heading-secondary">
            My biggest non-technical challenge for Bootcamp
          </h2>
          <p class="blog-container__text">
            I've never been the most confident person when it comes to
            presenting my work to others, but that's something I've put on my
            priorities to learn.
          </p>
          <p class="blog-container__text">
            I am often my own worst critic and I can be very hard on myself when
            it comes to my work. This can make it difficult to present my work
            to others, especially when I am not confident in what I have
            created.

            Human skills I Would Like To Develop
          </h2>
          <p class="blog-container__text">
            One of the things I want to focus on improving is my ability to
            articulate my thoughts. I want to be able to explain my ideas
            clearly and concisely. I also want to be able to have discussions
            with other developers and be able to bounce ideas off of them.
          </p>
          <p class="blog-container__text">
            I think that by improving my ability to communicate, I'll be able to
            improve my overall development skills. I'll be able to collaborate
            more effectively, and I'll be able to better understand the ideas of
            others. This will ultimately make me a better developer.
          </p>
          <h2 class="heading-secondary">My Bootcamp Expectations</h2>
          <p class="blog-container__text">
            I am expecting an inclusive environment where everyone is working
            together to learn and grow. I know that I will receive feedback from
            my peers and the facilitators, and I am looking forward to using
            that feedback to improve my skills. I am also expecting to have good
            communication with the facilitators so that I can get the most out
            of the program.
          </p>
          <h2 class="heading-secondary">Expectations Of Myself At Bootcamp</h2>
          <p class="blog-container__text">
            As I embark on my journey at Dev Academy Bootcamp, I have a few
            expectations of myself. Firstly, I expect to put 100% effort into
            each task. This means that I will give my all to every project and
            task, and not half-heartedly complete them. <br /><br />
            Secondly, I will ask for help when needed. I know that there will be
            times when I am struggling and need assistance, so I will not
            hesitate to ask for help from my peers or facilitators. <br /><br />
            Finally, I will be punctual. This means that I will attend each
            class on time and be prepared with any materials needed.
            <br /><br />
            I expect these things of myself so that I can make the most of my
            time at Dev Academy and come out as a skilled and knowledgeable
            developer.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="blog-container flex column tab__content tab__content--2">
          <h2 class="heading-secondary">My long term goal</h2>
          <p class="blog-container__text">
            My ultimate career goal is becoming a full stack software
            developer.<br />I aim to be able to develop applications from
            scratch, from how the site looks, to how the site functions, and
            everything in-between. I want to be able to join a team of
            developers and be comfortable with the tasks that I am given.
            <br />I believe this is a realistic goal for me, as I understand
            that all it takes to achieve this is hard-work and consistency.
            Enspiral Dev Academy will help me achieve this.
          </p>
          <h2 class="heading-secondary">
            My strengths and limitations of learning
          </h2>
          <p class="blog-container__text">
            My main strength when it comes to learning, is that I love a
            challenge. From a young age, I have always enjoyed taking things
            apart and putting them back together to see how they work. When it
            comes to learning, I find enjoy difficult situations where I have to
            really think about what I am doing, in order to achieve what I want.
            <br /><br />
            One of my weaknesses is that I can be a bit of a workaholic. It can
            be an issue, as I can get so involved in my work, that I forgot
            about other commitments. This is something that I am working on, and
            will soon have a good understanding about how to balance work and
            life.
          </p>

          <h2 class="heading-secondary">What skills I want to develop</h2>
          <p class="blog-container__text">
            One of the main reasons for me joining Dev Academy, was the range of
            core skills that they teach. <br />
            As my prior programming experience has been self taught, I have not
            had the experience of learning the human skills needed to become a
            great developer. <br />This is my main priority and I am really
            excited to start this journey and look back at how far I have come,
            once it is over.
          </p>

          <h2 class="heading-secondary">How I will manage my workload</h2>
          <p class="blog-container__text">
            During my time at Dev Academy, I am making it a goal to manage my
            time well. <br />I will be using Notion to organise my time and to
            make sure that I am staying on track. <br />I also have a whiteboard
            that I write out my goals for the day and the challenges that I
            might come across.
          </p>
          <h2 class="heading-secondary">Seeking Help</h2>
          <p class="blog-container__text">
            I am well aware of what burnout is, and I will not be putting myself
            in a position where that could occur. If I am struggling, I will be
            reaching out to my facilitators and peers for help and guidance.

          <p class="blog-container__text">
            I am in a position currently, where I can dedicate my time fully to
            studying at Dev Academy. Things may come up once in awhile, but I
            will always make sure that it is communicated to my facilitator.

            I am in a position currently, where I can dedicate my time fully to
            studying at Dev Academy. Things may come up once in awhile, but I
