          <h2 class="heading-secondary">My long term goal</h2>
          <p class="blog-container__text">
            My ultimate career goal is becoming a full stack software
            developer.<br />I aim to be able to develop applications from
            scratch, from how the site looks, to how the site functions, and
            everything in-between. I want to be able to join a team of
            developers and be comfortable with the tasks that I am given.
            <br />I believe this is a realistic goal for me, as I understand
            that all it takes to achieve this is hard-work and consistency.
            Enspiral Dev Academy will help me achieve this.
          </p>
          <h2 class="heading-secondary">
            My strengths and limitations of learning
          </h2>
          <p class="blog-container__text">
            My main strength when it comes to learning, is that I love a
            challenge. From a young age, I have always enjoyed taking things
            apart and putting them back together to see how they work. When it
            comes to learning, I find enjoy difficult situations where I have to
            really think about what I am doing, in order to achieve what I want.
            <br /><br />
            One of my weaknesses is that I can be a bit of a workaholic. It can
            be an issue, as I can get so involved in my work, that I forgot
            about other commitments. This is something that I am working on, and
            will soon have a good understanding about how to balance work and
            life.
          </p>

          <h2 class="heading-secondary">What skills I want to develop</h2>
          <p class="blog-container__text">
            One of the main reasons for me joining Dev Academy, was the range of
            core skills that they teach. <br />
            As my prior programming experience has been self taught, I have not
            had the experience of learning the human skills needed to become a
            great developer. <br />This is my main priority and I am really
            excited to start this journey and look back at how far I have come,
            once it is over.
          </p>

          <h2 class="heading-secondary">How I will manage my workload</h2>
          <p class="blog-container__text">
            During my time at Dev Academy, I am making it a goal to manage my
            time well. <br />I will be using Notion to organise my time and to
            make sure that I am staying on track. <br />I also have a whiteboard
            that I write out my goals for the day and the challenges that I
            might come across.
          </p>
          <h2 class="heading-secondary">Seeking Help</h2>
          <p class="blog-container__text">
            I am well aware of what burnout is, and I will not be putting myself
            in a position where that could occur. If I am struggling, I will be
            reaching out to my facilitators and peers for help and guidance.
          </p>
          <h2 class="heading-secondary">
            What I expect from the Facilitation team
          </h2>
          <p class="blog-container__text">
            I expect a fun and safe learning environment, where everyone is
            included and feels comfortable seeking help.
          </p>
          <h2 class="heading-secondary">Scheduling Information</h2>
          <p class="blog-container__text">
            I am in a position currently, where I can dedicate my time fully to
            studying at Dev Academy. Things may come up once in awhile, but I
            will always make sure that it is communicated to my facilitator.
