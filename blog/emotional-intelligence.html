          <h2 class="heading-secondary">What is Emotional Intelligence(EQ)?</h2>
          <p class="blog-container__text">
            Emotional intelligence is the ability to perceive, understand, and
            manage your emotions, and the emotions of others. The term was
            coined in 1990 in a research paper by two psychology professors,
            John D. Mayer of University of New Hampshire and Peter Saleovey of
            Yale. <br />
            The importance of the term was not fully recognised until 1998,
            where Rutgers psychologist Daniel Goleman wrote about it in an
            article for Harvard business review.
          </p>

          <h2 class="heading-secondary">What is Intelligence quotient(IQ)?</h2>
          <p class="blog-container__text">
            IQ is a measure of a person's cognitive abilities and potential in
            comparison to others. <br />
            The measure if derived from one of several standardized tests
            designed to assess human intelligence. IQ is used as a predictor for
            academic and job performance.
          </p>
          <h2 class="heading-secondary">How is it different to IQ?</h2>
          <p class="blog-container__text">
            When comparing people who have a high IQ but an average EQ and
            people who have a high EQ but an average intelligence, the people
            with higher EQs tend to be more successful in life. This is due to
            IQ only being a measure of ones intelligence, where EQ measures both
            cognitive and emotional ability. <br /><br />
            The people who have high EQs have a better understanding of
            themselves and others, which allows them to be able to relate to
            people at a deeper level. Most of the Successful leaders tend to
            have high EQ, which allows them to motivate and inspire others.
          </p>

          <h2 class="heading-secondary">EQs Importance to me?</h2>
          <p class="blog-container__text">
            I love Programming, it's my passion and I spend a lot of time doing
            it. <br />The problem with this is that it can get very stressful at
            times as it requires long hours, intense concentration and tight
            deadlines. Increasing my emotional intelligence is one of my main
            goals in life, as I believe that it truly is the key to success.<br /><br />
            Increasing my emotional intelligence will allow me to collaborate
            better with others and build strong relationships. Being a good
            communicator and team worker is one of the most important skills in
            any workplace as I believe strong relationships can make or break a
            project.
