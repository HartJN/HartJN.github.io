          <p class="blog-container__text">
            The term was first used by Polish neuroscientist Jerzy Konorski in
            1948 to describe observed changes in neuronal structure. <br />
            Neuroplasticity is the brains ability to change and adapt in
            response to experiences. It allows out brain to reorganise itself
            and create new neural connections. Changes in neuroplasticity can be
            observed through learning, but it can also be observed when the
            brain is damaged.
          </p>

          <h2 class="heading-secondary">Neuroplasticity & Me</h2>
          <p class="blog-container__text">
            I am a life long learner. Learning new things is what fuels my mind
            and body. Neuroplasticity is important to me as I am constantly
            learning a vast array of topics, ranging from engineering to
            practical life skills. Neuroplasticity allows my brain to adapt and
            create new neural pathways when learning.
          </p>

          <h2 class="heading-secondary">Increasing Neuroplasticity</h2>
          <p class="blog-container__text">
            There are a number of ways to improve your brains neuroplasticity.
            Some ways that work for one person, may not work for another but the
            core concepts tend to stay the same between everyone.

          <h2 class="heading-secondary">What Is A Growth Mindset?</h2>
          <p class="blog-container__text">
            Growth mindset is the belief that intelligence is not determined by
            birth, but something that can be developed.<br />
            This is the opposite of a fixed mindset, which is the belief that
            your intelligence and abilities are fixed traits which you are born
            with.
          </p>
          <p class="blog-container__text">
            Having a growth mindset is important as it can lead to increased
            motivation. If you believe that your abilities are not limited and
            you can improve with effort and practice, you are likely to see a
            large improvement. <br />
            fixed mindset, on the other hand, can discourage you, leading to
            giving up easily when facing a problem.
          </p>
          <p class="blog-container__text">
            For me personally, I have always understood that level of success is
            down to the amount of effort you put in. Sure, there are limiting
            factors such as money, but your success in life will always
            reflected by the effort you put into it.

            Sometimes when I see the work others have done, I look at it and

            it through hard work and persistent training. <br />
            I know that if I put in the effort and practice into learning
            something, I will get rewarded with the success I strive for.
