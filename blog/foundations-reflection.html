          <h2 class="heading-secondary">What I Have Learnt About Myself</h2>
          <p class="blog-container__text">
            Throughout completing the foundation curriculum, I discovered new
            things about myself. <br /><br />
            First I found that I am my own biggest critic. I would put off
            posting my work for others to see, as I could see all the flaws in
            my eyes, and it was not up to the standard that I set for myself.
            After posting my work, I found that I did not receive the negative
            criticism that my brain would tell me would happen and that it was
            all in my head.
          </p>
          <p class="blog-container__text">
            I found that reflecting on what I have done, is a great way to
            retain what has been taught. Throughout the day, I write down notes
            of new things that I have learnt, or found interesting, and later in
            the day, I reflect on what I have written. <br />I have found that I
            have retained a lot more than in my previous study due to this.
          </p>

          <p class="blog-container__text">
            Finally, I learnt what some of my weaknesses are, and what I need to
            work on to improve. I have made it a priority to focus on improving
            my human skills and to work on my weaknesses.
          </p>

          <h2 class="heading-secondary">
            Values, Empathy, Self-Awareness & Programming
          </h2>
          <p class="blog-container__text">
            Collaboration is a big part of programming. In order for your team
            to succeed, you need to be able to communicate well with each other.
            Having good values, high empathy and self-awareness is what makes
            you succeed as a team player, as this gives you a deeper
            understanding of ourselves and others, allowing us to manage our
            emotions, stress and make more informed decisions.
          </p>

          <h2 class="heading-secondary">Surprises & Challenges</h2>
          <p class="blog-container__text">
            During foundations, It was a bit of a shock to realise how much I'd
            been neglecting my own identity and values. For a long time, I had
            been focused on other things and I'd let my own needs and wants fall
            by the wayside. <br /><br />
            Throughout this course, the core topics made me think deeply about
            who I am and what I stand for. It was hard to do at first but it
            made me realize that I need to make time for myself too. I need to
            take control of my own identity and make sure that my values are
            reflected in my everyday life.
          </p>

          <h2 class="heading-secondary">Why Is Core Learning Important?</h2>
          <p class="blog-container__text">
            I believe that learning the core skills that Dev Academy covers, is
            very important and not a waste of time. From an industry point of
            view, web development is a rapidly changing field; the tools you use
            every day, may not be the same you use in a year. <br />
            However core skills are something that stays linear throughout your
            career. <br /><br />
            Core topics such as Mindset, identity, and values are important for
            everyone because they help us understand our strengths and
            weaknesses, set personal and professional goals, and stay motivated
            throughout our careers. <br />Knowing these core skills is what
            separates good programmers from the best.
